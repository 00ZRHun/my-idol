          <p>Mask was born in Pretoria (South Africa) on June 28, 1971.
            Nobody saw the deputies of the future billionaire in a small mask.
            He could long disconnect from reality, immersed in reflections, why even went for an autista.
            The boy has grown closed, loved reading and, having photographic memory, read many encyclopedias.
            For the weekend he swallowed two or three books. Not at all interested in sports
            The lessons could argue about the settlement of other planets and solar energy.
            At the age of 10, he independently learned to program, and was also carried away by rocketodelism.
            By the way, it is to hit classmates, Ilon designed his first rocket at school.</p>

      <div class="post-text">
        <p>In an effort to America with the whole soul, after school Ilon took advantage of the changes in the Canadian legislation,
          Allowed to "inherit" the Canadian citizenship of the mother.Documents had to wait almost six months,
          During which Ilon studied physics at the University of Pretoria.</p>
        <p>Nobody waited in Canada Mask. All the first year in the new place Ilon was looking for random earnings,
          Not completely related to programming or engineering.
          So the future billionaire remembers the work on the wood sawmill:
          "For $ 18 per hour, it was required to crawl through a narrow tunnel, in which you barely squeeze.
          Then a shovel throw sand, dirt and smoking coals - everything is hotnown -
          Through that hole in which you squeezed here. It is impossible to move ...
          If you stay there longer than half an hour, you can get a heat strike and die. "
          Of the 30 people until the end of the week, only three reached, including a mask.</p>

          <p>Mask entered the Royal University in Kingston (Canada).
          Soon he continued his studies at the University of Pennsylvania (USA),
          Where and received degrees in physics and economics.After the release from the University, Ilon decided to receive a degree
          PHD (Candidate of Science) in the University of Stenford, but ultimately threw this idea and decided to test his luck in the beginning Internet fever.
          I will never remember Elon Musk about studying in Stenford.</p>
