                    <p>Elon Musk paired another disclosure that he’s disposed more Tesla Inc. stock with a joke tweet about quitting his jobs.</p><br>
                    <p>Tesla’s chief executive officer offloaded another $963 million worth of shares to pay taxes on the exercise of an additional 2.2 million options, according to regulatory filings dated Thursday. He’s now disposed of about $11.8 billion worth of stock over five weeks.</p><br>
                    <p>The world’s richest man then quipped a couple hours after the filings posted that he had found a new calling.</p><br>
                    <p>“Thinking of quitting my jobs & becoming an influencer full-time,” Musk wrote, asking his almost 66 million followers what they thought of the idea. He followed this up with several laughing-emoji replies.Shareholders and regulators haven’t always appreciated the humor in Musk’s Twitter high jinks. </p>

                    <p>Time magazine has named Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk as its Person of the Year, for an incredible 12 months of achievements in which he jockeyed for the crown of world’s richest person and made his Twitter account a must-read while moving the needle on climate change, cryptocurrencies, space exploration, and universal broadband.</p><br>
                    <p>In April, NASA granted Musk’s rocket company SpaceX an exclusive contract to put United States astronauts on the moon for the first time since 1972 – moving Musk one step ahead of rival old-guard rocket firm Boeing and one step closer to his stated goal of helping to make humans a multi-planetary species.</p><br>
                    <p>In May, Musk hosted Saturday Night Live, using the television show as a platform to poke fun at himself and to raise awareness of Asperger syndrome, a mild form of autism, by announcing that he has it.</p>

                    <p>Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk unloaded $5 billion of stock in the electric-car maker, shortly after restoking a social media debate over the tax treatment of billionaires’ shareholdings.</p><br>
                    <p>The world’s richest person so far has disposed of more than 4.5 million shares this week, according to regulatory filings. Those were his first sales in more than five years.</p><br>
                    <p>Musk, who frequently stokes controversy on Twitter, created a firestorm over the weekend with a survey asking whether he should sell part of his Tesla stake. While he portrayed his proposal as having to do with debate over billionaires avoiding taxes, the filings released Wednesday show some of the transactions were pre-arranged in mid-September — weeks before the poll. He also didn’t mention in the tweets that he has millions of stock options that must be exercised before next August, when they expire.</p>
